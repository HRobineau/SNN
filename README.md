# **Simple Neural Networks**

SNN is a lightweight C++ library which focus on artificial neural Networks,
Aiming to be intuitive, fast & complete.

## Status

    This library is still in development
    However the core of the library works (Net/Neuron/Link classes, Activations Functions).

## Planned implementations:

    Neural Network Types:
        -Self-Organizing Maps
        -FeedForward
        -Convolutional
        -Recurrent
    
    Activations Functions (done):
        -Linear
        -Step
        -Sigmoid
        -Hyperbolic Tangent
        -Rectified Linear Unit

    Training Algorithms:
        -Backpropagation
        -Resilient Propagation
        -Genetic Algorithm 

    Model Selection:
        -Pruning
        -Regularization & Dropout
        -Grid search (brute force)
