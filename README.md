# **Simple Neural Networks**

SNN is a lightweight C++ library which focus on artificial neural Networks,
Aiming to be intuitive, fast & complete.

## Status

This library is still in development
However the core of the library works.

### Core Features:
```
- Net                   (done)
- Activations Functions (done)
- Layer/Neuron/Link     (done)
- FFNet                 (done)
- Backpropagation
- SOM
- Convolutional
- Recurrent
```

## Planned implementations:

* Neural Network Types:
    * Self-Organizing Maps
    * FeedForward
    * Convolutional
    * Recurrent
    
* Activations Functions:
    * Linear
    * Step
    * Sigmoid
    * Hyperbolic Tangent
    * Rectified Linear Unit

* Training Algorithms:
    * Backpropagation
    * Resilient Propagation
    * Genetic Algorithm 

* Model Selection:
    * Pruning
    * Regularization & Dropout
    * Grid search (brute force)

## Documentation

Documentation is planned.
